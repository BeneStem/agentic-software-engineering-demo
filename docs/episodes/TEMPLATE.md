## Usage Instructions

1. Copy this template when creating a new episode
2. Fill in all sections during Phase 3e (MEMORY) of TDD cycle  
3. Focus on capturing both technical knowledge and process insights
4. Use the retrospective sections to support continuous improvement
5. Be specific with examples and code references where possible
6. Fill action items that can be realistically implemented
7. Link to related episodes for pattern tracking and retrospective aggregation

### Retrospective Section Guidelines

- **What Went Well**: Celebrate successes to reinforce positive patterns
- **What Could Be Improved**: Focus on constructive feedback, not blame
- **4Ls Analysis**: Be honest but balanced in your assessment
- **Action Items**: Make them SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Consider both individual and team perspectives where applicable
