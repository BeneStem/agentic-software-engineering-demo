# C4 Architecture Documentation - Finden Product Search System

## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the **Finden** system using the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/). The C4 model describes software architecture through four levels of abstraction:

1. **System Context** - Shows how the system fits into the larger ecosystem
2. **Containers** - High-level technology choices and runtime components
3. **Components** - Internal structure of containers
4. **Code** - Implementation details (not covered in this documentation)

## About Finden

Finden is a **Self-Contained System (SCS)** that provides comprehensive product search, filtering, and listing capabilities. Built as part of a larger e-commerce ecosystem, it follows Domain-Driven Design principles with an Onion/Hexagonal architecture pattern.

### Key Characteristics
- **Technology Stack**: Vue.js 3 (Frontend) + Quarkus/Kotlin (Backend)
- **Database**: MongoDB for product storage
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka for event-driven communication
- **Architecture**: Self-Contained System with complete autonomy
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform

## Documentation Structure

This architectural documentation is organized into the following sections:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [System Context](./context.md) | External view showing users, external systems, and system boundaries |
| [Containers](./containers.md) | High-level technical building blocks and their interactions |
| [Components](./components.md) | Internal structure of key containers, focusing on the backend service |
| [Deployment](./deployment.md) | Infrastructure, environments, and deployment architecture |
| [Decisions](./decisions.md) | Key architectural decisions and their rationale |
| [Evolution](./evolution.md) | Historical development and future recommendations |

## Architecture Principles

### Self-Contained System (SCS)
- **Complete Autonomy**: Finden owns its UI, business logic, and data storage
- **Bounded Context**: Clear boundaries with other systems in the ecosystem
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-driven integration via Kafka
- **Independent Deployment**: Can be deployed without coordinating with other systems

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Onion Architecture**: Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **Immutable Value Objects**: Ensuring data integrity and thread safety
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access from business logic
- **Domain Events**: Capturing business-relevant state changes

### Technical Excellence
- **Type Safety**: Kotlin for backend, TypeScript for frontend
- **Reactive Patterns**: Vue.js Composition API, Quarkus reactive extensions
- **Cloud Native**: Containerized, stateless, horizontally scalable
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing

## Quick Navigation

- üéØ Start with [System Context](./context.md) for the big picture
- üèóÔ∏è Explore [Containers](./containers.md) for technical architecture
- üîß Dive into [Components](./components.md) for implementation details
- üöÄ Review [Deployment](./deployment.md) for infrastructure setup
- üìö Understand [Decisions](./decisions.md) for architectural rationale
- üìà Track [Evolution](./evolution.md) for historical context

## Maintenance Guidelines

This documentation should be updated when:
- New external integrations are added
- Major technology decisions are made
- Significant architectural refactoring occurs
- Deployment infrastructure changes
- New bounded contexts are introduced

### Version Information
