    }
}
```

#### Current State
```kotlin
// Repository pattern with abstraction
interface ProduktRepository {
    fun findByFilter(filter: ProdukteFilter): List<Produkt>
}

class ProduktMongoRepository : ProduktRepository {
    // Implementation details hidden
}
```

### API Design Evolution

### Code Organization
**Before**: Package by layer (controllers, services, repositories)
**After**: Package by feature with clear boundaries

### Security Enhancements
**Before**: Basic input validation
**After**: Comprehensive security measures including:
- OWASP dependency checking
- Input sanitization
- Parameterized queries
- Security headers

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimization Journey
1. **Initial**: No indexes, full collection scans
2. **Optimization 1**: Added basic indexes
3. **Optimization 2**: Compound indexes for common queries
4. **Current**: Full-text search, aggregation pipelines

### Caching Evolution
1. **No caching**: Direct database hits
2. **Application-level caching**: In-memory caches
3. **Database caching**: MongoDB WiredTiger
4. **Future**: Redis integration planned

### Frontend Performance
1. **Initial**: Client-side only rendering
2. **SSR Added**: Server-side rendering for initial load
3. **Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading
4. **Current**: Hybrid SSR/SPA approach
