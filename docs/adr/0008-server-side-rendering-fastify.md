# 8. Server-Side Rendering with Fastify

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The product search interface needs excellent SEO for product discoverability and fast initial page loads for user experience. Requirements include:
- Search engine optimization for product pages
- Fast time-to-first-byte (TTFB)
- Progressive enhancement from SSR to SPA
- Efficient server-side performance
- Support for caching strategies

Client-side only rendering has poor SEO and slow initial loads. Traditional SSR frameworks like Nuxt add complexity. A lightweight Node.js server provides flexibility.

## Decision

We will implement server-side rendering using:
- Fastify 4.x as the Node.js web server
- Vue Server Renderer for SSR
- Hybrid approach: SSR for initial load, SPA for navigation
- Server endpoints for health checks and metrics
- Manifest-based asset management
- Cache strategies for rendered pages

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Improved SEO through server-rendered HTML
- Faster perceived performance with quick initial render
- Progressive enhancement supports all clients
- Fastify provides excellent performance
- Flexible caching strategies possible
- Separation of concerns between SSR and API

**Negative:**
- Increased infrastructure complexity (Node.js server)
- Server resources required for rendering
- Hydration mismatches can cause issues
- Debugging SSR issues more complex
- Memory management on server important
- Additional deployment artifact to manage

**Neutral:**
- Different error handling for server vs client
- Need to manage server and client state
- Bundle splitting strategy important
