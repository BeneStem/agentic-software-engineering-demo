# 3. Use Kotlin for Backend Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The backend service requires a JVM language that provides modern language features while maintaining Java ecosystem compatibility. The team needs:
- Strong type safety to reduce runtime errors
- Null safety features to prevent NullPointerExceptions
- Concise syntax to improve code readability and reduce boilerplate
- Functional programming support for data transformations
- Excellent Java interoperability for existing libraries

Java is verbose and lacks modern language features. Scala has a steep learning curve. Kotlin offers a good balance between modern features and pragmatic design.

## Decision

We will use Kotlin 2.x for all backend development following these principles:
- Immutable data classes with `val` properties
- Null safety operators (`?.`, `?:`) instead of explicit null checks
- Extension functions for utility methods
- Functional operations (`map`, `filter`, `fold`) over imperative loops
- Sealed classes for domain modeling
- Coroutines for asynchronous operations (future consideration)

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Null safety eliminates entire class of runtime errors
- 40% less code compared to equivalent Java implementation
- Improved readability through concise syntax
- Seamless Java interoperability allows use of existing libraries
- Data classes eliminate boilerplate for DTOs and entities
- Pattern matching with `when` expressions improves control flow

**Negative:**
- Slightly longer compilation times compared to Java
- Team learning curve for Kotlin-specific features
- IDE support slightly behind Java in some areas
- Debugging can be more complex due to syntactic sugar
- Some Java tools may not fully support Kotlin

**Neutral:**
- Different coding conventions from Java
- Kotlin-specific libraries and frameworks emerging
- Build configuration requires Kotlin plugin
