# 14. No Personal Data Storage (GDPR Compliance)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system operates in the European Union and must comply with GDPR regulations. The product search functionality doesn't inherently require user identification. Requirements include:
- GDPR compliance without complex data management
- Anonymous search functionality
- Reduced security and privacy risks
- Simplified compliance processes
- Analytics without personal information

Storing personal data would require consent management, data subject requests, and complex compliance processes.

## Decision

We will store no personal data in the Finden system:
- All search operations are anonymous
- No user profiles or accounts in this system
- No search history linked to users
- Analytics use aggregated, anonymous data only
- No cookies for user tracking
- IP addresses not stored or logged
- Authentication handled by infrastructure layer only

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simplified GDPR compliance
- No data subject access requests to handle
- Reduced security risk from data breaches
- No consent management required
- Lower operational complexity
- Clear privacy-by-design approach

**Negative:**
- No personalized search results
- Cannot implement user-specific features
- Limited analytics insights
- No search history for users
- Cannot optimize based on individual behavior
- Competitive disadvantage vs personalized search

**Neutral:**
- Different approach to analytics and optimization
- Focus on aggregate rather than individual patterns
- Clear communication about privacy approach needed
