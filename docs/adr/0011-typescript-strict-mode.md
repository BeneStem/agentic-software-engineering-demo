# 11. TypeScript in Strict Mode

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The frontend codebase needs type safety to prevent runtime errors and improve developer productivity. Requirements include:
- Catch type errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through types
- Refactoring safety
- Integration with Vue.js 3

JavaScript's dynamic typing leads to runtime errors that could be caught at compile time. TypeScript provides optional static typing for JavaScript.

## Decision

We will use TypeScript in strict mode for all frontend code:
- `strict: true` in tsconfig.json
- No implicit any types allowed
- Strict null checks enabled
- All Vue components written in TypeScript
- Interfaces for all props and emits
- Type definitions for API responses
- Typed Vuex store and modules

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Catches type errors at compile time
- Excellent IDE support with autocomplete
- Self-documenting through type definitions
- Safer refactoring with compile-time checks
- Better collaboration through explicit contracts
- Reduced bugs in production

**Negative:**
- Additional build step and complexity
- Learning curve for TypeScript features
- More verbose code with type annotations
- Some JavaScript libraries lack type definitions
- Compilation time increases
- Strict mode can be initially frustrating

**Neutral:**
- Need for consistent typing patterns
- Balance between type safety and flexibility
- Type definition maintenance required
