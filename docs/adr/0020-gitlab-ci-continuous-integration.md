# 20. GitLab CI for Continuous Integration and Deployment

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project needs automated building, testing, and deployment pipelines. Requirements include:
- Automated testing on every commit
- Container image building and registry
- Multi-stage deployment pipelines
- Integration with Kubernetes
- Secret management
- Parallel job execution

Jenkins requires separate infrastructure. GitHub Actions has vendor lock-in concerns. GitLab CI is integrated with the code repository.

## Decision

We will use GitLab CI for all CI/CD pipelines:
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` for pipeline definition
- Multi-stage pipeline: build → test → package → deploy
- GitLab Container Registry for Docker images
- GitLab CI variables for secrets
- Parallel execution for frontend and backend
- Protected branches for production deployments
- Manual approval gates for production

Pipeline stages:
1. Build: Compile code, run unit tests
2. Test: Integration tests, security scanning
3. Package: Build Docker images
4. Deploy: Deploy to Kubernetes environments

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Integrated with code repository
- No separate CI infrastructure needed
- Built-in container registry
- Good Kubernetes integration
- Parallel job execution
- Easy secret management

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in to GitLab
- YAML configuration can become complex
- Limited to GitLab runners capabilities
- Debugging pipeline issues can be difficult
- Runner resource management needed

**Neutral:**
- Different from other CI/CD tools
- Pipeline optimization important for speed
- Regular runner updates needed
