# 15. Prometheus Metrics and Monitoring

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system needs comprehensive monitoring for performance, availability, and business metrics. Requirements include:
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Custom business metrics
- Alert generation for issues
- Historical data for trend analysis
- Integration with Kubernetes
- Standardized metrics format

Various monitoring solutions exist. Prometheus is the de facto standard for Kubernetes environments and provides powerful querying capabilities.

## Decision

We will use Prometheus with Micrometer for metrics collection:
- Micrometer for metrics abstraction in Quarkus
- Prometheus format for metrics exposition
- Metrics endpoints: `/q/metrics` (backend), `/metrics` (frontend)
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards
- Standard metrics: RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) and USE (Utilization, Saturation, Errors)
- Custom business metrics for search queries, filter usage
- Stackdriver integration for GCP

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Industry standard for Kubernetes monitoring
- Powerful PromQL query language
- Excellent Grafana integration
- Pull-based model suits Kubernetes
- Time-series data enables trend analysis
- Low overhead metrics collection

**Negative:**
- Metric cardinality must be managed carefully
- Storage requirements for time-series data
- Learning curve for PromQL
- Additional infrastructure to maintain
- Need to avoid high-cardinality labels

**Neutral:**
- Different from traditional APM solutions
- Requires careful metric design
- Alert rule management needed
