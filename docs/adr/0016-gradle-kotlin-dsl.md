# 16. Gradle with Kotlin DSL for Build Management

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The backend project needs a build tool that supports Kotlin, manages dependencies, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines. Requirements include:
- Native Kotlin support
- Dependency management with version control
- Multi-module project support
- Integration with quality tools (testing, linting, security scanning)
- IDE support
- Build reproducibility

Maven is XML-based and verbose. Gradle with Groovy DSL lacks type safety. Gradle with Kotlin DSL provides type-safe build configuration.

## Decision

We will use Gradle with Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts):
- Type-safe build configuration
- Kotlin DSL for all build scripts
- Platform BOM for dependency version management
- Integration with Detekt for code quality
- OWASP dependency check for security
- TestContainers for integration testing
- Avro plugin for schema generation

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Type-safe build configuration with IDE support
- Consistent language (Kotlin) for app and build
- Powerful dependency management
- Incremental builds improve performance
- Rich plugin ecosystem
- Better refactoring support

**Negative:**
- Slower initial build configuration parsing
- Steeper learning curve than Maven
- Build script debugging can be complex
- Gradle daemon memory usage
- Version compatibility issues possible

**Neutral:**
- Different from Maven conventions
- Build cache configuration important
- Regular Gradle wrapper updates needed
