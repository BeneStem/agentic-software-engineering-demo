# 4. Onion/Hexagonal Architecture with Domain-Driven Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The codebase needs clear separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns. Key requirements include:
- Testable business logic independent of frameworks
- Clear boundaries between different concerns
- Protection of domain logic from external changes
- Support for different adapters (REST, messaging, database)
- Maintainable and understandable code structure

Traditional layered architecture creates dependencies from domain to infrastructure. This makes testing difficult and couples business logic to technical choices.

## Decision

We will implement Onion/Hexagonal Architecture with three distinct layers:

**Domain Layer (Core):**
- Pure business logic with no external dependencies
- Immutable value objects for domain concepts
- Aggregate roots for consistency boundaries
- Domain services for complex business rules
- Repository interfaces (ports) for data access

**Application Layer:**
- Use case orchestration
- Transaction management
- DTO definitions for external contracts
- Mappers between domain objects and DTOs
- Application services coordinating domain operations

**Adapter Layer (Infrastructure):**
- REST controllers for HTTP endpoints
- Repository implementations for MongoDB
- Kafka consumers for event processing
- External service clients
- Configuration and framework-specific code

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Domain logic completely independent of infrastructure
- Easy to test business logic in isolation
- Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
- Can switch infrastructure components without changing domain
- Follows SOLID principles and clean architecture
- Aligns with Domain-Driven Design practices

**Negative:**
- More boilerplate code for mappings between layers
- Initial learning curve for team members
- Additional complexity for simple CRUD operations
- More files and packages to navigate
- Potential for anemic domain models if not careful

**Neutral:**
- Requires discipline to maintain layer boundaries
- Need for clear guidelines on what belongs in each layer
- Testing strategy must cover each layer appropriately
