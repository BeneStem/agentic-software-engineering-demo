# 9. Kubernetes Deployment on Google Cloud Platform

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs cloud-native deployment with automatic scaling, self-healing, and multi-region capabilities. Requirements include:
- Container orchestration for microservices
- Automatic scaling based on load
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Infrastructure as code
- Integrated monitoring and logging
- Cost-effective resource utilization

Various cloud providers and orchestration platforms were evaluated. GCP provides good Kubernetes integration with GKE, and the team has GCP experience.

## Decision

We will deploy on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with:
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Separate namespaces for backend and frontend
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU/memory
- Node pools with different configurations for workloads
- Google Cloud Load Balancer for ingress
- Workload Identity for service authentication
- Multi-zone deployment in europe-west3

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Automatic scaling handles load variations
- Self-healing through pod restarts and node repairs
- Infrastructure as code enables reproducible deployments
- Rolling updates provide zero-downtime deployments
- Good integration with GCP services
- Cost optimization through preemptible nodes

**Negative:**
- Kubernetes complexity requires specialized knowledge
- Vendor lock-in to GCP services
- Debugging distributed systems is challenging
- Network policies and security require careful configuration
- Cost can escalate without proper monitoring
- State management for stateful services complex

**Neutral:**
- Different deployment patterns from traditional servers
- Monitoring and logging aggregation needed
- Secret management requires careful consideration
