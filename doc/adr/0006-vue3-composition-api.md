# 6. Vue.js 3 with Composition API

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The frontend requires a modern JavaScript framework that supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and single-page application (SPA) modes. Requirements include:
- TypeScript support for type safety
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- State management for complex UI interactions
- SEO optimization through SSR
- Good developer experience and tooling

The team has experience with Vue.js 2. Vue 3 offers significant improvements including better TypeScript support, Composition API for better code organization, and improved performance.

## Decision

We will use Vue.js 3.2 with Composition API exclusively:
- TypeScript in strict mode for all components
- Composition API instead of Options API
- Vuex 4 for centralized state management
- Vue Router 4 for client-side routing
- Server-side rendering with @vue/server-renderer
- Component structure: base components, layout components, business components

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better TypeScript integration with Composition API
- More flexible component composition and logic reuse
- Improved performance through Proxy-based reactivity
- Better tree-shaking reduces bundle size
- Cleaner separation of concerns in complex components
- Setup script syntax reduces boilerplate

**Negative:**
- Breaking changes from Vue 2 require migration effort
- Learning curve for Composition API patterns
- Some Vue 2 libraries not compatible
- More verbose for simple components
- Mental model shift from Options API

**Neutral:**
- Different testing patterns with Composition API
- Need for consistent coding conventions
- Ref vs Reactive requires careful consideration
