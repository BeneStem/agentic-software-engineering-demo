# 1. Self-Contained System Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The e-commerce platform requires multiple teams to work independently on different business capabilities. Each team needs autonomy over their domain while maintaining integration with the broader ecosystem. The product search functionality represents a distinct bounded context that needs to be isolated from other system components like user management, order processing, and payment systems.

Traditional monolithic architectures create tight coupling between teams, making independent deployment and scaling difficult. Microservices could provide isolation but would require significant operational overhead and complex service orchestration.

## Decision

We will implement Finden as a Self-Contained System (SCS) following these principles:

- Complete ownership of UI, business logic, and data storage
- Own web interface with no shared UI components between SCS boundaries
- Dedicated MongoDB database with no direct database access between systems
- Asynchronous communication via Apache Kafka for inter-system integration
- Independent deployment lifecycle without coordination requirements
- Authentication and authorization handled by infrastructure layer

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Teams can deploy independently without coordinating with other teams
- Clear boundaries reduce cognitive load and improve maintainability
- System resilience through fault isolation
- Technology choices can be made independently per SCS
- Scaling can be done independently based on specific needs

**Negative:**
- Data duplication between systems may occur
- Eventually consistent data model requires careful consideration
- No direct database joins possible with other systems
- Additional complexity in maintaining system boundaries
- Potential for divergent technical solutions across teams

**Neutral:**
- Each SCS maintains its own deployment pipeline
- Monitoring and logging must be aggregated across systems
- API contracts between systems must be carefully managed
