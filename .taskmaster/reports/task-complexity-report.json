			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create Beschreibung Value Object",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the Beschreibung value object into: 1) Create the basic data class structure with proper package placement, 2) Implement validation logic in init block with proper error messages, 3) Add the sanitized() method signature that delegates to service, 4) Write comprehensive unit tests covering all edge cases",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational domain object with moderate complexity. It requires understanding of value object patterns, validation requirements, and proper domain modeling. The sanitization delegation adds a layer of complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Content Sanitization Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement the sanitization service in stages: 1) Set up the service class with proper annotations and dependency injection, 2) Integrate and configure HTML sanitization library (OWASP or JSoup), 3) Implement core sanitization methods with proper configuration, 4) Add comprehensive XSS attack vector handling, 5) Create extensive test suite for all attack patterns",
			"reasoning": "Security-critical component requiring careful library selection, configuration, and extensive testing. XSS prevention requires deep understanding of attack vectors and proper implementation of sanitization rules."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Update Produkt Entity with Beschreibung Field",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Modify the Produkt entity systematically: 1) Add the beschreibung field with proper type and nullability considerations, 2) Update MongoDB mapping annotations and ensure proper field serialization, 3) Update and run all existing tests to ensure backward compatibility",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward entity modification, but requires careful consideration of backward compatibility, MongoDB mapping, and impact on existing code."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Database Migration Script",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a robust migration system: 1) Research and set up migration tooling (Mongock or custom), 2) Write the forward migration script with proper error handling, 3) Implement rollback script and test rollback scenarios, 4) Add migration tracking and idempotency checks, 5) Create performance tests for large datasets, 6) Document migration procedures and add to CI/CD pipeline",
			"reasoning": "Database migrations are critical operations requiring careful planning, error handling, performance considerations, and rollback strategies. The need for idempotency and performance testing on large datasets adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add MongoDB Text Index for Search",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement text indexing strategically: 1) Create the text index with proper language and case-insensitive settings, 2) Integrate index creation into migration or startup process, 3) Implement performance benchmarks to validate <200ms requirement, 4) Add monitoring for index performance and write impact",
			"reasoning": "Index creation requires understanding of MongoDB text search capabilities, performance implications, and proper configuration for German language support. Performance validation is critical."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Update ProduktRepository with Search Methods",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Enhance repository with search capabilities: 1) Implement basic findByBeschreibungContains method with proper query construction, 2) Add pagination support for large result sets, 3) Handle special characters and injection prevention, 4) Create comprehensive integration tests with TestContainers",
			"reasoning": "Repository modifications require careful query construction, performance optimization, security considerations for injection prevention, and thorough integration testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance ProduktService with Beschreibung Operations",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Update service layer systematically: 1) Add create/update methods with beschreibung handling, 2) Integrate sanitization service with proper error handling, 3) Implement search method delegation to repository, 4) Write unit tests with proper mocking",
			"reasoning": "Service layer modifications are straightforward but require proper integration of sanitization, error handling, and coordination between multiple components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create ProduktDto with Beschreibung Field",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create or update DTO: 1) Add beschreibung field with proper type and annotations, 2) Add validation annotations (@Size, @NotBlank), 3) Write serialization/deserialization tests",
			"reasoning": "Simple DTO modification with standard validation annotations. Low complexity but requires attention to API contracts and backward compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ProduktMapper for DTO Conversion",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement mapper methods: 1) Create toDto method with proper null handling, 2) Create toEntity method with value object construction, 3) Write comprehensive unit tests for bidirectional mapping",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward mapping implementation but requires careful handling of value object conversion and null cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Update REST Endpoints for Beschreibung Support",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Update REST endpoints comprehensively: 1) Modify GET endpoint to support search query parameter, 2) Update POST/PUT endpoints for beschreibung handling, 3) Add proper OpenAPI documentation, 4) Implement error handling and status codes, 5) Create integration tests with REST Assured",
			"reasoning": "REST endpoint modifications touch multiple HTTP methods, require proper parameter handling, documentation, and comprehensive integration testing to ensure API contract compliance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build complete test coverage: 1) Create unit test suite for all new components, 2) Implement integration tests with TestContainers, 3) Build API tests with REST Assured, 4) Create end-to-end test scenarios, 5) Add performance tests for response time validation, 6) Set up code coverage reporting and CI integration",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing across multiple layers requires significant effort, different testing frameworks, performance validation, and CI/CD integration. High complexity due to breadth of testing required."
