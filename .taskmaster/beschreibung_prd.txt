# Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing our Produkt entity by adding a descriptive text field. Currently, our products lack a dedicated field for a detailed description, which limits our ability to provide rich information to customers via the API, and subsequently hampers search and SEO capabilities on any consuming client application.

This feature is primarily for API Consumers (e.g., frontend applications, third-party services) and the Developers who build them. The addition of a beschreibung (description) field will directly increase business value by enabling richer product detail pages, improving on-site search relevance, and enhancing SEO performance for any client application that consumes our API.

# Core Features

* Product Description Field (beschreibung): Introduces a new text field named beschreibung to the Produkt entity. This field will store a descriptive text for each product. It is essential for displaying product details, enabling descriptive searches, and providing content for search engines. The field will be a new column in the Produkt table, managed and exposed via our REST API. The system will enforce a maximum length of 500 characters and sanitize any HTML content.
* API Filtering by Description: Allows consumers of the REST API to filter the product list based on the content of the beschreibung field. This is critical for building search functionality in any client application. The GET /api/finden/produkte endpoint will be updated to accept a new query parameter that performs a case-insensitive "contains" search on the beschreibung field.

# User Experience

Since there is no administrative UI, the "user" in this context is a developer consuming the API.

* User Personas:
  * Frankie (Frontend Developer): Frankie is building a new e-commerce website using our API. They need to fetch product descriptions to display on detail pages and implement a search feature that queries against the description text.
* Key User Flows:
  * Searching for a Product (Frankie's Flow):
    1. Frankie's application captures a search term from an end-user.
    2. The application makes a GET request to the API endpoint /api/finden/produkte?beschreibung_contains={searchTerm}.
    3. The API returns a filtered list of products where the search term is found within the beschreibung field.
    4. The application then displays the results to the end-user.

# Technical Architecture

* System Components: The changes will be confined to the backend application service. No new services are required.
* Data Models:
  * Produkt Entity: The existing Produkt entity/model will be modified to include: beschreibung: String.
  * Database Schema: The Produkt table will be altered to add a new column: beschreibung: VARCHAR(500). This column should default to an empty string '' and not be nullable. An index must be created on this column to optimize search performance.
* APIs and Integrations:
  * Value Object: The beschreibung field will be implemented as a value object to encapsulate validation logic (max 500 characters).
  * Sanitization: The existing content sanitization library will be used to process the beschreibung field before persistence to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
  * REST API Modifications:
    * GET /api/finden/produkte: The response body will include the beschreibung field.
    * GET /api/finden/produkte: This endpoint will be enhanced with a new filter parameter (e.g., beschreibung). The logic will perform a case-insensitive LIKE '%...%' search.

# Development Roadmap

* MVP Requirements: The goal is a complete backend implementation, fully testable via the API.
  * Phase 1: Backend Foundation:
    1. Create and apply a database migration script to add the beschreibung column with an index to the Produkt table.
    2. Update the Produkt entity/model in the backend code.
    3. Implement the Beschreibung value object, integrating the existing sanitization library and adding length validation.
    4. Adjust database indexes if neccessary to preserve performance
  * Phase 2: API Logic & Exposure:
    1. Integrate the new field into the existing CRUD (Create, Read, Update) logic in the service and repository layers.
    2. Update the API controllers and DTOs to accept and return the beschreibung field.
    3. Implement the "contains" filtering logic for the GET /api/finden/produkte endpoint.

# Logical Dependency Chain

* 0. Start with the Domain Model (Domain)
* 1. Database & Backend Model (Foundation): The process must start with the data layer. The database schema change and backend entity update are prerequisites for any other work.
* 2. API Endpoint Logic (Enablement): Once the model is updated, the API logic must be changed. First, ensure the field can be created/updated (POST/PUT) and retrieved (GET). Then, implement the filtering logic. At this point, the feature is fully testable and usable by API consumers.

# Risks and Mitigations

* Risk: Poor API performance when filtering products by description on a large dataset.
  * Mitigation: The beschreibung column must be indexed in the database from the start. Perform load testing on the API endpoint in a staging environment to confirm performance.
* Risk: Database migration could be slow or fail on a large production database.
  * Mitigation: Test the migration script extensively on a staging environment that mirrors production data size. Plan for a maintenance window if necessary and ensure a rollback plan is in place.
* Risk: Inconsistent sanitization rules being applied.
  * Mitigation: Ensure the single, existing sanitization library is used for all processing of the beschreibung field. Document its usage clearly in the code.
